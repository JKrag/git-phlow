## Install pre-release binary from AWS bucket

Start by installing git-phlow via scoop, so the scoop folder structure has been created and the PATHS are set correctly. This can be skipped if you already have git-phlow installed via scoop or you know access and `exe` file within the windows path from powershell.

1. Download the binary from AWS and unzip it. It should contain a `git-phlow.exe` file.

2. Navigate to your scoop folder which is commonly located at `C:\Users\$USER\scoop\apps\git-phlow`.

You will have folder called current, which contains a `git-phlow.exe` and two JSON files.  Replace the `git-phlow.exe` with the `git-phlow.exe` you dowloaded from AWS.  This only works if you used the scoop installation.

Now you should successfully have installed the pre-release.
